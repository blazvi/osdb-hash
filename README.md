The protocols main purpose is to eliminate the painful process of searching for subtitles on the web and make finding subtitles to your videos as fast and simple as possible.

      file = "test/breakdance.avi",
      osdb = new OSDbHash(file),
      onNotify,
      onCompute,
      onError;
    
  onNotify = function (message) {
      console.log(message);
  };
      
  onCompute = function (hash) {
      console.log(hash);
  };
      
  onError = function(err) {
    console.log(err);
  };
    
  osdb.compute(onNotify).then(onCompute).catch(onError);
